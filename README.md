### Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">  
LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems are widely used in mobile and airborne mapping at
various scales. Airborne surveys enable to map wide areas at high speed and relatively low resolution,
while unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used to get a detailed description of local areas. LiDAR systems
are composed of a positioning system (GNSS receiver), an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a LiDAR
measuring relative distances to the terrain.

Georeferencing is performed by combining LiDAR angles and distance measurements, IMU attitude
angles and GNSS positions with a point positioning mathematical model. This model depends on several
parameters which are sources of systematic errors that can be observed by comparing overlapping survey
strips [1].
